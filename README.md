MeriSKILL Data Analysis and Visualization Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a data analysis and visualization project that explores insights from a dataset provided by MeriSKILL. The project uses SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization to extract valuable information and present it in an easily digestible format.

Dataset
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset used in this project is provided by MeriSKILL. It contains data related to sales, products, and various other information that we aim to uncover insights from.

Project Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Analyze and extract meaningful insights from the dataset using SQL.
2. Visualize the insights and findings using Power BI.

Insights Discovered
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the course of this project, we have uncovered several valuable insights from the data:

1. Total Sales: We calculated the overall total sales from the dataset, providing an understanding of the scale of business operations.

2. Total Products: We determined the total number of products in the dataset, giving insights into the product catalog size.

3. Most Selling Item: We identified the best-selling product or item, which is crucial for understanding customer preferences.

4. Highest City by Sales Revenue: We determined the city with the highest sales revenue, helping us focus on areas of business strength.

5. Sales Trend Over The Year: We analyzed the sales trend over time, allowing us to identify seasonal variations or trends.

6. Top 5 Selling Products: We listed the top 5 selling products, providing information on the best-performing products.

7. Top 5 Cities for Sales: We identified the top 5 cities for sales, which is essential for targeting marketing efforts.

Tools Used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SQL: SQL was used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

2. Power BI: Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations and reports.

3. Microsoft Excel: Excel was used for data cleaning and preprocessing.

How to Replicate the Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dataset: Obtain the dataset provided by MeriSKILL and place it in the appropriate location.

2. Data cleaning with Excel:
Open the dataset in Microsoft Excel and perform data cleaning and preprocessing as required.

3. SQL Analysis:
Open your preferred SQL database management tool.
   
Execute the SQL queries provided in the project's SQL script to perform data analysis.

5. Power BI Visualization:
Import the cleaned and preprocessed dataset into Power BI.
   
Use the dataset to create visualizations and reports as demonstrated in the project.
